### 1. **Frontend Dockerfile (`frontend/Dockerfile`)**

This will:
- Use Node.js to build the static files.
- Serve them with a lightweight web server (like `nginx`), or you can use Viteâ€™s preview server for simplicity.

**Recommended: Use nginx for production.**

---

### 2. **Backend Dockerfile (`backend/Dockerfile`)**

This will:
- Use Node.js to install dependencies and run your Express server.

---

I will now generate the Dockerfiles for both.
You now have production-ready Dockerfiles for both your frontend and backend:

---

**Frontend (`frontend/Dockerfile`):**
- Multi-stage build: builds with Node, serves with nginx.
- Uses a custom `nginx.conf` for proper SPA routing.

**Backend (`backend/Dockerfile`):**
- Installs dependencies and runs your Express server on port 5000.

**Next steps:**
- You can build and run each service with Docker, or create a `docker-compose.yml` for easier orchestration.
- Make sure to set up your environment variables (e.g., `.env` files) and mount or copy them as needed.

Let me know if you want a `docker-compose.yml` or further help!
